Begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down in a place where you will not be disturbed. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in for a count of four, hold, then exhale slowly and deeply for a count of eight.

Feel the rush of air entering your body, filling your lungs. Then, feel it exiting, taking with it any tension and stress. With each breath, you are becoming more relaxed, sinking deeper into a state of tranquility.

Now, visualize a warm, soft light enveloping your body, starting from your feet. Feel this light as a blanket of comfort, soothing and melting away any tension in your toes, your heels, and your ankles.

This comforting light slowly rises, releasing tension, bringing in relaxation into your lower legs, your knees, your upper legs. You might feel your muscles going limp and loose.

Allow this light to keep rising, spreading a sense of calmness into your stomach, chest, your heart space - each breath making you feel lighter, and more at peace.

Feel the light wrapping your arms, hands and fingers, releasing any stress held in them. Now, the light envelops your shoulders, neck and your head, making them feel lighter, relieving them of all the burdens and worries of the day.

Now, visualize a peaceful place. A place that makes you feel calm, serene and safe. It could be a beach, a forest, a river, an imaginary room - anywhere that makes you feel at peace.

Hear the gentle sounds. See the sights. Feel the textures. Taste the air. Immerse yourself completely in this place. Dwell on each sensory experience and let it lull you deeper into relaxation.

And as you continue to observe this place, you realize that everything in this world is at a standstill. The leaves on the trees don't tremble. The waves on the beach aren't crashing. Everything is enveloped in absolute calmness, and you're part of it.

Continue breathing in deeply, holding and exhaling slowly. You are falling deeper and deeper into tranquility with each breath, the peaceful scenery continuing to calm your senses. 

Now, slowly, direct your attention back to your body. You are relaxed, rejuvenated. You are in the present moment, free from the thoughts of past and future. Acknowledge this feeling of peace that's washed over you.

With final deep breath in, hold and then release, allow your consciousness to fall into a slumber, carrying with it the peaceful environment you created and the feeling of relaxation.

Now, give in to the heaviness of your eyelids. You are peaceful. You are calm. You are ready to sleep.
